DNA reverse complement challenge
==================================

- reading a fasta file
- perform reverse complement
- save result in fasta file
- Each scritp should have a class called DNAReverseComplement and a method
  called run that does the reading/writing/complement



To retrieve the sequence to play with, type::

    wget ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-77/fasta/homo_sapiens/dna/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna.chromosome.10.fa.gz 


The test should run on the uncompressed file. 

Another sequence that could be used is in https://github.com/pynxton/course_data/ecoli_dna.fa
