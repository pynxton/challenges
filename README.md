Challenges
==========

This repository can be used to host description, code and benchmarks on questions/challenges related to bioinformatics that have been proposed on the pynxton mailing list. The level of the challenges can be of any kind but an emphasize on educational challenges (writing a piece of code from scratch is not to time-consuming) is encouraged.
