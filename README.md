Challenges
==========

This repository can be used to host description, code and benchmarks on questions/challenges related to bioinformatics that have been proposed on the pynxton mailing list. The level of the challenges can be of any kind but an emphasize on educational challenges (writing a piece of code from scratch is not to time-consuming) is encouraged.

The main idea behind these challenges is collaboration (not competition) and therefore we encourage people to share/update code that are in place withi each challenge directory.

Here is a short description and link to each  challenge directory
